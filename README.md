## 🔧 How It Works

### Automatic Matching Process

AnswerFinder tries 4 matching methods automatically, from fastest to most comprehensive:

```
User selects text
    ↓
Tier 1: Exact Match (instant)
    ↓ no match
Tier 2: Keyword Match (fast)
    ↓ no match
Tier 3: Fuzzy Match (typo-tolerant)
    ↓ no match
Tier 4: Partial Match (flexible)
    ↓ no match
AI enabled? → Generate answer (2-4s)
    ↓
Display result with confidence score
```

**You configure nothing** - it just works!

### Matching Examples

| Your Question                    | Finds Database Entry             | Method  |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------- |
| "What is the capital of France?" | Exact same                       | Exact   |

## 📂 Data Format Guide

**Advantages:** Handles thousands of entries, supports Unicode, validates easily

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "answer": "a² + b² = c² - In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of squares of the other two sides."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who discovered penicillin?",
    "answer": "Alexander Fleming in 1928"
  }
]
```

**Tip:** Validate your JSON at [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com) before uploading

### TXT (Best for Quick Notes)

```text
What is the Pythagorean theorem?
a² + b² = c² - In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of squares of the other two sides.

Who discovered penicillin?
