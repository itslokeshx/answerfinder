## 🔧 How It Works

AnswerFinder uses a sophisticated **5-Tier Matching System** to find the best answer:

### Tier 1: Exact Match

```
Perfect character-by-character match
Confidence: 100% | Speed: <1ms
```

The fastest method - searches for identical questions in your database.

### Tier 2: Keyword Match

```
Matches based on important words
Confidence: 85-95% | Speed: <5ms
```

Extracts key terms and finds questions with the same core concepts.

### Tier 3: Fuzzy Match

```
Handles typos and variations
Confidence: 70-85% | Speed: <10ms
```

Uses advanced algorithms to match similar questions even with spelling errors.

### Tier 4: Partial Match

```
Finds answers for incomplete questions
Confidence: 60-75% | Speed: <15ms
```

Useful when you select only part of a question.

### Tier 5: AI-Powered Answer

```
Generates intelligent responses
Confidence: Variable | Speed: ~2-4s
```

When no local match is found, AI generates an answer with reasoning.

### The Matching Flow

```
User selects text
        ↓
   Normalize text
        ↓
   Try Exact Match ────→ Found? → Return answer
        ↓ No
   Try Keyword Match ───→ Found? → Return answer
        ↓ No
   Try Fuzzy Match ─────→ Found? → Return answer
        ↓ No
   Try Partial Match ───→ Found? → Return answer
        ↓ No
   AI Fallback (if enabled) ────→ Generate answer
        ↓ No/Disabled
   Return "No match found"
```

## 🤖 AI-Powered Answers

When your local database doesn't have an answer, AnswerFinder can use AI to help you!

### What is AI Fallback?

AI Fallback is a smart feature that:

- ✅ Generates accurate answers to questions not in your database
- ✅ Provides step-by-step reasoning
- ✅ Works with various question types (math, science, history, etc.)
- ✅ Respects your privacy through a secure proxy

### How AI Works

1. **Question is sent** to a proxy server (not directly to AI providers)
2. **AI model (Gemma 2)** analyzes the question
3. **Structured response** is generated with answer + reasoning
4. **Result displayed** in the same clean format

### Enabling AI

1. Open AnswerFinder popup
2. Scroll to Settings section
3. Check "Enable AI for Answers"
4. (Optional) Set your proxy URL if using a custom backend

### AI Response Format

AI answers include:

- **Direct Answer:** Clear, concise response
- **Reasoning:** Why the answer is correct
- **Confidence:** AI's certainty level
- **Source:** Indicates this is an AI-generated response

### Privacy & Limits

- 🔒 Questions are routed through a proxy for anonymity
- 📊 100 AI queries per day (default limit)
- ⚡ Cached answers are reused to save queries
- 🔐 No personal data is stored or transmitted

---

## 📂 Data Formats

### JSON Format (Recommended)

**Best for:** Large question banks, complex data, easy backup

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is photosynthesis?",
    "answer": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?",
    "answer": "William Shakespeare"
  }
]
```

**Advantages:**

- ✅ Easy to edit and maintain
- ✅ Supports special characters
- ✅ Can be validated for errors
- ✅ Works with thousands of entries

### TXT Format (Simple)

**Best for:** Quick study sheets, simple Q&A pairs

```text
What is photosynthesis?
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.

Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?
William Shakespeare
```

**Format Rules:**

- ❗ One question per line, followed by the answer
- ❗ Separate each Q&A pair with a blank line
- ❗ No special formatting needed
