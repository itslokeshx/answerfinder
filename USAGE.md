## ⚙️ Settings Explained

### Fuzzy Matching

- **What it does:** Handles typos and spelling variations
- **When to enable:** Almost always (recommended)
- **Example:** Matches "Wha is Paris?" with "What is Paris?"

### Partial Matching

- **What it does:** Finds answers even if you select only part of a question
- **When to enable:** When you frequently select partial text
- **Example:** "capital of France" matches "What is the capital of France?"

### Minimum Confidence

- **What it does:** Sets how strict the matching should be
- **Recommended:** 50% for balanced results
- **Lower (30-40%):** More results, less accurate
- **Higher (60-80%):** Fewer results, more accurate

### AI for Answers

- **What it does:** Uses AI when no local match is found
- **When to enable:** When you need answers to questions not in your database
- **Cost:** ~$0.0001 per query (nearly free!)
- **Limit:** 100 queries per day
